## Project Overview

The backend allows children to interact with an AI English tutor through voice. The main workflow:

1. Receive audio file from the frontend.  
2. Convert audio to WAV format.  
3. Transcribe audio into text using Whisper model via Together AI.  
4. Generate AI response based on mode (`free-chat` or `roleplay`) using Together AI.  
5. Return both user text and AI response to the frontend.  

---

## Features

- Audio upload and processing
- Audio â†’ WAV conversion
- Speech-to-text transcription
- AI response generation with roleplay support
- Chat history management
- Serverless-ready structure (optional)
- Error handling and cleanup of temporary files

---

## Project Flow

1. **Frontend** â†’ Sends audio + metadata (`mode`, `roleplayTopic`) to backend `/api/chat`.  
2. **Express Route** â†’ `chatRoutes.js` handles `/chat` POST request using `multer` to parse audio.  
3. **Controller** â†’ `chatController.js` orchestrates:  
   - Audio conversion (`audioService.js`)  
   - Transcription (`transcriptionService.js`)  
   - AI response (`aiService.js`)  
   - File cleanup (`cleanup.js`)  
4. **Response** â†’ Returns JSON with `userText` and `aiReply`.
